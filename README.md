Text-to-Speech: Converts text responses to speech using pyttsx3.
Online Searches: Conducts searches online using webbrowser and fetches information from Wikipedia.
Application Control: Opens and interacts with various applications installed on your system.
Web Automation: Performs automated web tasks, including fetching content using requests and parsing HTML using BeautifulSoup.
Geolocation Services: Finds locations and calculates distances using the geopy library.
System Monitoring: Provides information on CPU and memory usage with psutil.
Jokes and Entertainment: Tells jokes using pyjokes.
Automation and Controls: Automates tasks like keystrokes with pyautogui.
Math and Computation: Solves mathematical queries using WolframAlpha's API.
Screen Capturing and Computer Vision: Utilizes OpenCV for screen capturing and other computer vision tasks.
